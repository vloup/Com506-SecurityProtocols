Here is a list of changes I made since my presentation.

* Fix the ISO number, the correct one is 19772 for authenticated encryption. ISO 19972 is for hydraulic fluid power, most likely not what I wanted.
* Slide 23: Untruncatable C (not T since it's not there).
* Slide 16: 160 combinations, not 120 (just a typo).
